# Data Repository and FBGroup

We have created a GitHub repository. Link - https://github.com/RJV5174/HCIEducationResources. Additionally, you might want to join the group at https://www.facebook.com/groups/msphdhci

## People you can contact 
I always request people to ask their questions right here in the group. Two reasons, (1) that is the easiest manner in which you can help others. Another person with similar interest gets immense help from reading these posts. You might have already got some from the files I have posted here. Imagine me sending them in a private email to another person. (2) People who are helping are doing a kind of favor in their limited time. We save time when we write a group post as the number of people who reach out to you personally reduce drastically.
That being said, I understand you will have a personal queries in lot of instances. For those purposes, I have put up names of few people you can contact along with the areas they can help you.
Adithya VR - Students pursuing PhD/MS in HCI or related fields in US.
Tejas Bhalerao - Students pursuing MS (specially in UMBC), internship, job in UX and related fields in US.
Pinaj Basutkar - Students pursuing MS (specially in RIT), internships, job in UX and related fields in US.

A note -

This list is not exhaustive. There are definitely others who hide in shadows, like vigilantes and help people behind the scenes. A big thank you to those people!  As a junior you free to contact anyone you like. Seniors, we would be happy to have you here as some one who can guide newcomers. Please contact me to add your name here.
